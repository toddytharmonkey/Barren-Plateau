This data was collected when I was still using two for loops to collect mutual information data, i.e with n_a theta samples and n_p different measurement configurations. See the code how it was on about 1/4/2024 for more context on how this was done. 

I believe these samples were generated before I made a bugfix involving np.newaxis, so take them with a grain of salt. They do, however, seem to match up with the results after I made the np.newaxis fix.
