Here are two different types of result files. First is the new "[n_qubits]_layered_results_samples_changeboth" files. Those are generated by the new mutual_info_change_all_hyperparameter file. Note that there is also a file with _1000 attached after it. Those are actually generated using 10,000 samples, I just made a typo. The files without that _1000 are generated using 1000 samples. Here there are also the _layeredresult.npy files that are not _samples_, and are from the old mutual info results folder. 

using the _plot.py files you can make a bunch of different useful plots to visuallize the mutual information data, as well as deal with the different formats from the _samples and _layeredresult.npy files. In the current iterations of the code, we try to generate samples and calculate things with them after, rather than generating just the results, so that we can deal with the statistics or gather up old results as necessary.
