# Measurement Induced Landscape Transitions 

This is the code used to calculate the results in "Measurement-induced landscape transitions in hybrid variational quantum circuits", https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09135. The scripts used to actually generate the are located with their respective reuslts in the results folder. The four python files here labelled MILT are the core files which the scripts utilize.

# Installation

Simply clone the repository and run the script files as desired to regenerate the data used to generate the plots. You can also use or expand on any of the functions located within the four core files. 

Python library requirements are mostly found at the top of `MILT_Core.py`. They include SciPy, openfermion, dask, NumPy, and quspin.
